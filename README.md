AI Virtual Mouse using OpenCV and Mediapipe
To implement an AI virtual mouse using OpenCV, you can combine computer vision techniques for hand tracking with basic mouse control commands. Here's a general approach to follow:

Steps to Implement AI Virtual Mouse Using OpenCV:
1. Install Dependencies: You need OpenCV, Mediapipe (for hand tracking), and pyautogui (for mouse control).
2. Set up Hand Tracking: Mediapipe provides a Hand module for detecting hand landmarks. You'll need to extract the positions of the fingertips to control the mouse.
3. Map Hand Movements to Screen: Capture hand movements
